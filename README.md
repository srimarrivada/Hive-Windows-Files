# Hive-Windows-Files
It consists of all windows files (.cmd) that are needed to run Apache Hive 3.1.3 version on Windows operating system.

Reference: https://github.com/HadiFadl/Hive-cmd/tree/master/bin

Some `.cmd` files from the above Github link are not working properly, so I modified them into working condition. Additionally, I added `schematool.cmd`, `metatool.cmd`, `version.cmd` and other `.cmd` files. 

You can just download these files, copy to the exact folder structure in HIVE_HOME directory and start running.
